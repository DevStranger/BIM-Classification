## Week 1 â€“ Project Setup & Baseline Prototype

- [x] github and virtual environment setup
- [x] base model setup: sentence-transformers + cosine similarity â€” multilingual MiniLM tested and running
- [x] project planning
- [x] further research 

## Week 2 â€“ Data Structuring & Pretraining Preparation 

- [x] download and save (JSON) bSDD dictionaries
- [x] define export format for BIMVision: GlobalId, IFC type, BaseQuantities, PSet, ARCHICAD classification
- [ ] create IFC property-to-text parser (BaseQuantities + PSet descriptions)
- [ ] prepare unlabeled IFC-like corpus (~500â€“1000) for TSDAE pretraining
- [x] extract snapshot of CCI and Uniclass classes for baseline model
- [ ] begin manual few-shot labeling (20â€“30 samples with CCI or ARCHICAD codes)
- [X] research hybrid classification strategy (embedding + classification layer)
- [X] update plan.md ðŸ˜Š

## Week 3 â€“ Preparing for TSDAE Pretraining

- [x] test the data extractor for BIMVision
- [x] extract sample IFC and test the model
- [x] create IFC property-to-text parser (BaseQuantities + PSet descriptions)
- [ ] prepare unlabeled IFC-like corpus (~500â€“1000) for TSDAE pretraining
- [ ] research
