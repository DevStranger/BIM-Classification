## Week 1 – Project Setup & Baseline Prototype

- [x] github and virtual environment setup
- [x] base model setup: sentence-transformers + cosine similarity — multilingual MiniLM tested and running
- [x] project planning
- [x] further research 

## Week 2 –  Data Expansion & Pretraining Preparation

- [ ] extend the IFC sample data (more component descriptions from BIMVision or manual)
- [ ] prepare unlabeled sentence corpus for TSDAE training (exported or composed from IFC-like data)
- [ ] investigate and clarify: access to full CCI/Uniclass dictionaries (JSON/CSV/API)
- [ ] decide on fallback plan if API access to bSDD remains blocked (e.g. static JSON snapshots)
- [ ] begin preparing few-shot dataset (hand-label 20–30 samples with CCI codes)
- [ ] research hybrid approach (classification layer)

## Week 3 – Preparing for TSDAE Pretraining

- [ ] format TSDAE training corpus (one sentence per line, cleaned)
- [ ] configure and run TSDAE training with domain-specific text
- [ ] save sentence embeddings for both CCI classes and IFC components (as .npy or .json)
- [ ] further research
 
## Week 4 – TSDAE Training & Embedding Comparison

 - [ ] compare TSDAE vs baseline embeddings using cosine similarity
 - [ ] evaluate Top‑1 / Top‑3 accuracy before/after TSDAE
 - [ ] analyze misclassified samples and build visualization of embedding space (e.g. PCA / t-SNE)
 - [ ] further research
